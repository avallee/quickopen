---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Dont use extensions in raw index; fix those up afterward.

- Use current-buffer and active-buffer list in ranking

- Try out Goog codesearch-style trigraph-based indexes for fuzzy matching

- rwh::ddu -> use ctags to do fuzzy search for ddu on the files matching rwh

- Add fuzziness to dir matching and ranking?

- Speed up indexing operation

- Reduce memory footprint

- Right click to ignore an object in open dialog

- Warning bar if search() truncated

- emacs ffap-alist support

- qo-modded ff-find-*-file should catch things like foo.cc -> foo_unittest.cc or foo_test.py
