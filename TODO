Implement rescan database button

random hangs in emacs when i pick something

- Make search_async on the proxy
- Distinguish between search-failed-because-of-sync vs
  sync-failed-unexpectedly

- Improve query perf [got slow with word matchers]


- Warning bar if search().truncated

- Emacs C-N C-P move selection up and down

- Have vim survive if quickopen throws exception



- Better matching with partials:
   rwhwin -> render_widget_host_view_win
   rwfsp -> render_widget_fullscreen_pepper

- Extension queries: What shoudl abc.c match?

- Speed up empty-dir-query, e.g. foo/
- Support wildcard-dir-query, e.g. f*b/*
